Displays random messages on Admin pages in the style of the Hello Dolly plugin. Includes 3 link buttons. Easy to customize.
== Description ==
Displays inspirational random quotes on your Admin pages to bring happiness and fulfillment while you work.

In the style of the ubiquitous Hello Dolly plugin, Happiness Today is built using the Pods CMS plugin and [Pods Plugin Builder](http://www.shrewdies.net/blog/pods-plugin-builder/ "WordPress Pods Plugin Builder") as an example of basic Pods ease-of-use.

It is supplied with the lyrics for Think Of Happiness Today, shared under a Creative Commons licence by [Soft Charisma](http://www.softcharisma.com/ "Soft Charisma"), and 3 relevant links, all of which can be easily customized. You could use a different song, or install on your client sites with sales messages and support links. The possibilities are endless.

Happiness Today requires [Pods CMS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pods/ "Pods CMS Plugin"), [Pods UI](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pods-ui/ "Pods UI Plugin"), and PHP**5**.
== Installation ==
1. Download to your computer and upload to your web server plugins directory, or use the inbuilt WordPress installer.
1. Activate.
1. Optional: customize the lyrics or the links using the standard Pods edit screens, with full instructions at yoursite.dne/happiness_today

== Why Pods? ==
Though Pods is designed as a Content Management System to extend the functionality of your front end pages, it is useful wherever you have data that you need to store or manipulate. I've used Pods in this instance in a similar way to Hello Dolly - to show a basic example of a Pods package to help you learn how to apply Pods techniques.

As well as basic data management, you can see how Pods templates help display data from tables. There is also an example of a Pods Page, which displays content on your front end like a normal WordPress page, but with the added flexibility of in-built PHP. Don't worry about messing up your current content - you can easily delete this example page without affecting the random message display in the admin area.
